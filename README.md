## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/f-huel/fazbear.git`

2. Install:

- [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

3. Start the server and import the database:

- Locate the database file in the folder *database* and import it in phpMyAdmin. `cd your/path/to/fazbear/database`

- Open Xampp and start Apache and MySQL.

Now you should be able to run the project on your localhost.

**NOTE**: If you prefer using anything else than Xampp, you could do that as well. I have used Xampp for this project, so I reccomend using that.


## Usage

### How to
To run the project, you need to start the server and import the database. You can do this by following the steps in the [Installation](#installation) section.

When you have done that, you can run the project on your localhost.
From this point, you can run tests to see if everything is working properly. You can find the tests in the [Tests](#tests) section.

You can also use the project as a template for your own website. You can do this by cloning the repository and editing the files to your liking.
