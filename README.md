## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/f-huel/fazbear.git`

2. Install:

- [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

3. Start the server and import the database:

- Locate the database file in the folder *database* and import it in phpMyAdmin. `cd your/path/to/fazbear/database`

- Open Xampp and start Apache and MySQL.

Now you should be able to run the project on your localhost.

**NOTE**: If you prefer using anything else than Xampp, you could do that as well. I have used Xampp for this project, so I reccomend using that.
